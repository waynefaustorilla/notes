Father in Heaven,
I come before You once more in prayer, humbly seeking Your guidance.
Lord, I ask for Your help in healing the relationship I have broken with Shane, the love of my life. I know my mistakes caused her pain, and for that, I am deeply sorry.

Please grant me the wisdom to grow into a better person â€” someone capable of loving selflessly and supporting her as she deserves. I still love her, Lord, with all my heart. I don't desire anyone else but her, yet I recognize that I am not yet mature enough to keep her.

Teach me patience and strength as I work on myself. And if it is Your will, Lord, may our paths cross again in Your perfect time, so I can love her in the way she deserves.
