Father, forgive me for I have sinned.

To completely confess my sins, I would like to tell you my story of how it all started.

I am the eldest son of 3 siblings in my family. I have 1 brother who just recently graduated Marine Engineering at Negros Maritime College, and one still in Grade 7.

Let's go back to how it all started, back in 2021.

In 2021, I took a job I didn't like working at SPI to only go AWOL after a month because it wasn't paying well and I wasn't treated right because of my performance. Given that situation, I decided to leave SPI and go back to my hometown in Santa Catalina.

Tried freelancing as a computer programmer online back home but my skills weren't good enough back then since I wasn't experienced back then. So, I decided to take up a coding bootcamp online to further enhance my skills. I took the entrance exam and told my father about it and he said he's fine with it.

After graduating the bootcamp, I went jobhunting to various companies online from April 2021 to August 2021. During that timespan, I was sending 20 applications per day to different companies online but to no avail, I failed each and every one of them.
